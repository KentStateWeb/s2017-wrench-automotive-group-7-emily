          <p> “I stand by Wrench in all they do. They get the job done and done right, without taking out a second loan on your home! Fast service and always with a smile! Love Wrench; I have been a client for years and will remain a client for years to come!” </p>

          <h3> Automotive Professionals </h3>
          <p> “I have dealt with Todd, Brian and the rest of the team at Wrench for over 7 years. The best way to judge a shop is when your entire experience has been completed you then ask yourself, "would I send my mother here to get her repairs done?" I can answer "yes" to that question! I deal with 350 accounts over a span of 7 different counties and have some idea of what people are looking for and Wrench fits that model. They participate in all of Jasper Engines and Transmissions technical and professional training. They are equipped with all the latest tooling to be able to diagnose and repair your car in a professional manner. If I can recommend my mother [to go] there I can certainly recommend you as well.” </p>

          <h3> Corvette Repair </h3>
          <p> “I recently had the team at Wrench Auto perform an engine replacement on my 1973 Corvette...not a minor repair to say the least. Todd, Brian, and the entire team were extremely professional, a pleasure to work with, and they did a fantastic job installing the new Jasper high performance engine. I would highly recommend Wrench Auto to anyone.” </p>

          <p> “I had my car at two other shops and it still had a check engine light. Todd and Brian fixed it fast and inexpensive. Thanks.” </p>
